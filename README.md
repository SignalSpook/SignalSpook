I have an interest in wireless networking security utilities in Linux.
Specifically, integrating low-cost and readily available wireless interfaces into SigInt hardware stacks.
After finding some incompatibilities in Airmon-ng, I've started writing a wireless inteface manager which works upstreeam of packet capture software.

I have achieved elementary literacy in C and Shell Script.
